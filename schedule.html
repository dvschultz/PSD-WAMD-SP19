	<h3>Week 5 <span>2/19/19</span></h3>
	<div class="week">
		<p><strong>Provocation #4: Let’s Remix It</strong> </p>
		<h4>Assignments:</h4>
		<p>There are two paths you can take:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Find a project on Glitch that relates to one of your previous sketches. Remix it on Glitch and make the changes you’d like to see in your own project.</li>
			<li>Find a project you like on Glitch. Remix it, but make sure you add to it using concepts we’ve previously discussed in class.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you’re not really into coding, you can still do the above assignment but not get into the coding portion. You should instead remix the work in Figma and focus solely on the design part of the work (visual design, interactions, experience)</p>

	<h3>Week 6 <span>2/26/19</span></h3>
	<div class="week">
		<p><strong>Design Project: Creating a Problem Statement</strong> We’ll wrap up the brainstorming portion of the class and start our longer project.</p>

		<h4>Assignments:</h4>
		<p>Come up with two projects you would like to continue with for the next ten weeks. Create a problem statement for both projects. Be sure to have a clear audience, a clear problem, and how interaction design can solve it. Refer to the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/x45axkgnz8mfgwz/Problem%20Statements.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">presentation</a> from this week.</p>

	<h3>Week 7</h3>
	<div class="week">
		<p><strong>Design Project: User Research</strong> Take your Problem Statement and add a layer of research to it. Guest Critic: <a href="guests.html#marie-mcgwier">Marie McGwier</a></p>

		<h4>Assignments:</h4>
		<p>Pick a final direction for your project. Remember to reference the  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/x45axkgnz8mfgwz/Problem%20Statements.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">presentation</a> from last week. If your project is not in the form of audience/problem/solution then it should be in the form of audience/reaction/activation. That should answer “What is the audience?”, "What is the reaction you believe the audience should get from this interaction?", and "How do you plan to activate this reaction using interactive technology?"</p>
		<p>Include both analytical and qualitative research into your problem statement. Analytical research might be articles you find on the internet or from other reputable resources. For the qualitative research, please create 3-6 survey questions. Find a good sample of people and record their results. Share these survey answers with me.</p>

	<h3>Week 8</h3>
	<div class="week">
		<p><strong>Design Project: Idea Generation and Storyboarding</strong> Let’s talk about our research. How did it alter our projects? Then we’ll make a bunch of concepts and figure out which ones to storyboard. Guest Critic: <a href="guests.html#liz-wells">Liz Wells</a></p>

		<h4>Assignments:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>In addition to the Crazy Eights you’ve done in class, do three more rounds of them. This should give you plenty of ideas to explore. Please photograph all of your crazy eights and put them in your Figma file.</li>
			<li>From all of your Crazy Eights, take three ideas and storyboard them. Each storyboard should include 6-8 panels. These panels should not be entirely UI screens; panels should also include context and point of view around use. Use the storyboards to tell the story about why your project solves your audience’s problems.</li>

	<h3>Week 9 <span>3/26/19</span></h3>
	<div class="week">
		<p><strong>Design Project: User Flows</strong> We’ll do a Q&A with some great designers. Then we’ll look at last week’s homework and do a quick exercise to understand how user flows work.</p>
		<h4>Assignments:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Choose four (4) important actions in your app. Write out the steps a user would have to follow to achieve them. Since its a mobile app consider if there are any device features that could be utilized.</li>
			<li>Draw a blockframe/wireframe for each of these steps in the four user flows.</li>
			<li>Find a couple potential users. Tell them the important actions in your app and ask them what they think the steps would be. Show them your user flows and see if they can guess what each block is.</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>Reading</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-biggest-wtf-in-design-right-now-87139f367d66">The biggest WTF in design right now</a> (I’m sorry. The title is terrible, the jokes are bad, but the content is good.)</li>

	<h3>Week 10 <span>4/2/19</span></h3>
	<div class="week">
		<p><strong>Design Project: Visual Design</strong> Let’s review the user flows we made for each action. Then we will work on the thing most of you are probably most excited by: visual design. Guest critic: <a href="guests.html#kelsey-hunter">Kelsey Hunter</a></p>

		<h4>Assignments:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Design two (2) directions for the design of your app. These designs do not need to be full style guides, but should account for typography, color, and button styles.</li>
			<li>Apply each of these design directions to your four action/user flows.</li>
			<li>Use each design direction to design one “marketing page” for your app. The point is not that it be a perfectly design marketing page, but that it uses the design system you have developed and shows how it can work beyond just the app.</li>
		</ol>

	</div>
	<h3>Week 11 <span>4/9/19</span></h3>
